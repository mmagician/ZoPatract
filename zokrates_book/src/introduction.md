# ZoPatract

[ZoPatract](https://patractlabs.github.io/ZoPatract) is a toolbox for zkSNARKs on Substrate. It helps you use verifiable computation in your DApp, from the specification of your program in a high level language to generating proofs of computation to verifying those proofs in [ink!](https://github.com/paritytech/ink).


## Background on zkSNARKs

 Zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) are a family of probabilistic protocols, first described by [Goldwasser, Micali and Rackoff](http://people.csail.mit.edu/silvio/Selected%20Scientific%20Papers/Proof%20Systems/The_Knowledge_Complexity_Of_Interactive_Proof_Systems.pdf) in 1985.

One particular family of ZKPs is described as zero-knowledge **S**uccinct **N**on-interactive **AR**guments of **K**nowledge, a.k.a. zkSNARKs. zkSNARKs are the most widely used zero-knowledge protocols, with the anonymous cryptocurrency Zcash and the smart-contract platform Ethereum among the notable early adopters.
